<b>Project 1: The iPal - An All-Encompassing Hands-Free Smart Assistant Platform</b>
<p>We propose the ‘iPal’: a new smart assistant platform designed to complement Apple’s existing devices. Promising easy integration with the familiarity of Siri, the iPal is poised to offer a more streamlined and accessible option over Google’s Home and Amazon’s Echo, while combining the functionality of all three. Siri’s API will enable fast communication with connected apps, so users need not worry about cluttering their personal devices with more software. Where competitors fall short on security, the iPal will prioritize user verification through voice recognition and two-factor authentication. </p>
